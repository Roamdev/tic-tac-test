## Testing

### Tooling

The project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing. These tools allow for effective testing of React components and interactions.

### Running Tests

### Test Coverage

- **Component Rendering**: Ensures all components render correctly.
- **User Interaction**: Tests cover basic interactions such as player name input and button clicks.
- **Edge Cases**: Ensures the game correctly identifies a winner and handles a draw.

### Extending Test Coverage

In a real project, I would add tests for:
- Testing on various devices and browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- Integration testing to verify interactions between components.

## Commits

- **Initial Commit**: Base project based on the React tutorial.
- **New Feature**: Added player name input form.
- **Tests**: Added tests for rendering, interactions, and edge cases.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates basic skills in working with React and component testing. It can be extended for more complex scenarios and integration with other systems.
